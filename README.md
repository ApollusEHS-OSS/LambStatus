## Benefits

* Lower operational cost. Serverless architecture eases your pain caused by the scaling / availability issues of status page
* Lower infrastructure cost. AWS Lambda pricing fits the traffic type of status page well: mostly small traffic and occasionally huge traffic.
* Modern status page design, inspired by [StatusPage](https://www.statuspage.io/)

## Features

* Components: show your service's status by components
* Incidents: open an incident and keep updating situations

*Note: LambStatus is still under development, and not ready for production use. Opening an issue / PR for feature request / bug report is welcome!*
